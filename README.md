# HoriseonSourceRefactor
Homework One: Source Refactor

* The goal was to clean up the HTML and CSS code by removing repetitive and unneeded code.

* Assigning pratical class or id names to describe the code used for particular sections.
    -ex. Removing <div> as a catchall, I added "main", "nav", "content", etc. to define where the code is being allocated in relation to the page.

* Links direct for all three information pockets (Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputaion Management, and Social Media Marketing)

* Active url's attached to github and gitpage accounts
